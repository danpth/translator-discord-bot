# Italian-Japanese translation bot "Koba-Chan"

## About this bot

As a japanese language learner I joined several language exchange discord servers. In particular I'm very active in an italian-japanese exchange server.
This server has a lot of begginer level learners that inevitably find themselves to often have to rely on automatic thranslation machines.
Because of that I thought it could have been educational to me (and, hopefully, useful to the server members) to try to learn how to create a discord bot that can translate a text into italian or japanese.
This bot I'm showing here is the result of my experiment.

### Requirements

- A discord acount to access the Discord Developer portal and creat the bot.
- A discord server where you can test and use your bot.
- A replit account to host and run your code.
- A UptimeRobot account to create a web server and keep your bot alive even when you close the replit tab (Replit keeps the app running for 30 minutes after closing the tab).
- A DeepL account to access their API

#### Libraries

- discord.py
- os
- deepl
- flask

## Add my bot to your discord server

## Learning Resources

- I learned everything that you need to now to start creating discord bots, hosting them on replit and deploy a server on UptimeRobbot watching this video on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok
